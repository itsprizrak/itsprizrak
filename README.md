## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Custom BLE Sensor Node  
Built with **ESP32 + NimBLE**, this project allows wireless streaming of environmental data (analog/digital sensors) via custom BLE characteristics. Also includes OTA update support and UART mirroring.

### 🔹 STM32 Multi-sensor Control System  
Developed a system on **STM32F103** that interfaces with:
- **VL53L0X / VL53L1X ToF** sensors  
- **MLX90614 temperature sensors**  
- **RFID (MFRC522) module**  
- **ST7789 LCD Display**  
- **Multiple Buttons** for user-defined modes (manual/preset)  
Supports **UART logging**, I2C/UART sensor handling, and safe shutdown behavior.

### 🔹 AWS-Based BLE Device Tracker  
Created a dashboard using **AWS + Python + Google Maps API** to track BLE-enabled devices in real-time, with GPS data visualization and remote command triggering.
